# Customer Segmentation and Purchasing Behavior Analysis for Chips Category

### Overview:
In this project, I analyzed customer transaction and behavior data to deliver strategic recommendations for the Category Manager of the Chips product line. The goal was to identify customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, understand key sales drivers, and provide actionable insights for improving the performance of the Chips category in the supermarket chain.

### What I Learned:
- **Data Preparation:** Gained expertise in cleaning and preparing transaction and customer data for analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Developed insights into customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
- **Data Visualization:** Created graphs and charts to present trends, anomalies, and insights from the data.
- **Insight Derivation:** Deriving actionable commercial recommendations from the analysis of purchasing behavior.

### Project Description:
I worked as part of Quantium’s retail analytics team to analyze a client’s transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviors. The Category Manager for Chips wanted to understand which customer segments are buying chips and what influences their purchasing decisions.

Here’s how I approached the task:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - I examined and cleaned the transaction data, identifying and handling inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
   - I merged the transaction and customer data into a clean, ready-to-analyze dataset.
   - Ensured data accuracy and integrity throughout the process.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Defined key metrics, such as total sales and sales drivers.
   - I analyzed trends in purchasing behavior and created visualizations to present key insights about customer behavior and the Chips category’s performance.
   - I identified which segments of customers were driving the most sales and where improvements could be made.

3. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - I segmented customers based on purchasing behavior and key demographic characteristics.
   - I analyzed how different customer segments (e.g., by age, location, income) interacted with the Chips product category.
   - Identified high-value segments contributing the most to overall sales.

4. **Commercial Recommendations:**
   - Based on my analysis, I provided strategic recommendations to the Category Manager on which customer segments should be targeted.
   - I proposed actions to drive higher sales in underperforming segments and suggested strategies to retain and engage profitable customer groups.

### Tools Used:
- **Python:** I used Python for data analysis, including libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data processing, visualization, and segmentation.
- **Data Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to effectively communicate the trends, outliers, and relationships in the data.

### Key Insights:
- I identified which customer segments were the most profitable for the Chips category and which segments had untapped potential.
- The analysis highlighted the key drivers of sales and areas where the supermarket could optimize product offerings and marketing strategies.
- I provided strategic recommendations for targeting profitable segments and optimizing product sales.

### Conclusion:
By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in data preparation, customer segmentation, and deriving actionable business insights. The insights I provided to the Category Manager were data-driven and supported strategic decision-making, allowing the supermarket to improve its approach to the Chips category.
